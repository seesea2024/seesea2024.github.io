sleuth & zipkin
----------
## sleuth
Spring Cloud Sleuth (org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-sleuth), once added to the CLASSPATH, automatically instruments common communication channels:

* requests over messaging technologies like Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ (or any other Spring Cloud Stream binder
* HTTP headers received at Spring MVC controllers
* requests that pass through a Netflix Zuul microproxy
* requests made with the RestTemplate, etc.

Spring Cloud Sleuth sets up useful log formatting for you that prints the trace ID and the span ID. 

## zipkin
Data collection is a start but the goal is to understand the data, not just collect it. In order to appreciate the big picture, we need to get beyond individual events.

For this weâ€™ll use the OpenZipkin project. OpenZipkin is the fully open-source version of Zipkin, a project that originated at Twitter in 2010, and is based on the Google Dapper papers.
