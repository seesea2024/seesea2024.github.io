单点登陆 - CAS <!--more-->

CAS is an authentication system originally created by Yale University to provide a trusted way for an application to authenticate a user.   CAS is an enterprise Single Sign-On solution for web services. Single Sign-On (SSO) means a better user experience when running a multitude of web services, each with its own means of authentication. With a SSO solution, different web services may authenticate to one authorative source of trust, that the user needs to log in to, instead of requiring the end-user to log in into each separate service.

  + the login URL, 
  + the validation URL, 
  + the optional logout URL.
