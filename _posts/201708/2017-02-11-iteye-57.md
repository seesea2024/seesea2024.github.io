Type 1: JDBC-ODBC Drawback: client code must be loaded and configured on each client machine.   

Type 2: A Native-API partly-Java driver JDBC call -> client API

* drawback: require native code on the client
* sample: Oracle OCI through SQL*net

Type 3: A Net-Protocol All-Java driver JDBC call -> DBMS-independent net protocol -> DBMS protocol(by middleware server)   

Type 4: A Native-Protoco All-Java driver JDBC call -> DBMS server 

* Sample: Oracle JDBC THIN driver
