when using JSF, some scenarios are difficult to deal with. e.g. 1. multi rows raido buttons in dataTable      2. multi columns radio buttons in dataTable      The radio buttons don't fall in the one radio group, so they don't behave as one radio group Solution: create customize component      step1, inherit and implement component class            add one overrideName field, so we can override the radio names generated by radio button. In this way, multi-row or column radios are considered in one radio group      step2, inherit and implement render class          override Decode(apply request phase, retrive the value from request obj and apply to component)          override Encode(render response phase)      step3, customize tag lib http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-02-2007/jw-02-jsf.html?page=2
